- Better error-reporting from the parsers. Use regexp-match-positions
  and set-port-next-location!.

- The markdown files could be shared as "recipes" ala Homebrew.

- Easy to express the recipes as JSON, too. Whether with the request
  and responses in their pre-parsed form, or post-parsed form, or
  both.
