- Finish fleshing out the Imgur, G+, and last.fm services in examples/

- Query parameters may be duplicated -- ex:
  http://developer.musicmetric.com/sentiment.html. Huh. Should handle
  same as http/head's heads-string->dict and heads-dict->string handle
  it. To store multi values for one key in the dict, separate them
  with \n?

- Try doing some services that require authentication.

- Try some AWS services with an Authorization header that requires
  calculating a signature based on other request elements. Allow a
  dict value to be a `lambda`, which is called with the dictionary
  after all non-lambda values are present??

- Currently the `.md` files are needed at runtime, and parsed at
  runtime. Is this a feature or a bug? If a bug, how to handle:

  - Is it possible do all this at the macro stage?

  - Should there be a `#lang wffi`?  (Only downside is putting a first
    #lang line changes this to be Racket-specific instead of
    universal.)

- Woolly ideas:

  - The markdown files could be shared as "recipes" ala Homebrew?

  - Should a JSON parse live on servers to be retrieved
    programatically?
